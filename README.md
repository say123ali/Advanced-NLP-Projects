### Extractive Text Summarization using LexRank
1. Text summarization is commonly used by several websites and applications to create news feed and article summaries.
2. Summarization is a technique to shorten long texts such that the summary has all the important points of the actual document.
#### Type of Summarization
1. Extractive Summarization: The extractive approach involves picking up the most important phrases and lines from the documents.
2. Abstractive Summarization: it uses new phrases and terms, different from the actual document, keeping the points the same, just like how we actually summarize. So, it is much harder than the extractive approach.
